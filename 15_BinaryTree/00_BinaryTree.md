# Tree ?
Non linear DS,  
One node connected with multiple nodes  
**BINARY TREE** : Less than or equal to 2 child nodes

---
**BASIC TERMS**
- Node for Binary Tree
  ```c++
  Class Node{
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;
  }
  ```
- Root Node : Starting parent
- Parent & Child Node
- Siblings : At Same Level
- Ancestors : Parent's Parent's Parent's...
- Descendants : Child's child's child...
- Leaf : No Child
