# GRAPHS
Collection of nodes & edges.
Tree was hierarchial, here we have nodes as neighbours

Nodes ? To store an entity.
Edges ? To make connection b/w edges.

**DEGREE ?**
No of edges connected to a node
In Directed graph we have
INDEGREE : Edges coming towards node
OUTDEGREE : Edges going out

## Types of Graphs
#### Based on Edges
1. Unidirectional : One Direction
2. Undirectional : No Direction
3. Bidirection : Both Way

#### Based on Weights
1. Weighted : Have weights (price, cost, distance etc.)
2. Non Weighted : Doesn't have weights

#### Based on Connection
1. Connectionless : Nodes can be disjoint
2. Connected

Graphs can be created using 
- Adjacency List,
- Adjacency Matrix,
- Edge List
- 2d Matrix

We have to store Nodes, & edges connecting them.

## Graph using Adjacency List
List in c++ ?
Same as doubly linked list

Operations -
push_front(), push_back()
pop_front(), pop_back()
front(), back(), size()
